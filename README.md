## Professional Philosophy
> "I have this habit where if I encounter a manual task, my brain immediately starts plotting how to automate it. While everyone's making API calls to large language models (which is cool!), I'm particularly excited about the future of small, specialized models running locally. I love that we live in a time where anyone can build anything."

I'm particularly interested in the evolution of AI towards efficient, specialized models running locally on devices - creating more responsive, private, and accessible intelligence for everyday use.

## The Atlas Paradox
![The Atlas Paradox: Carrying Digital Worlds While Standing in Human Reality](tech-identity-paradox.svg)

*In the space between binary and breath, between efficiency and existence, lives the most interesting paradox of our time: those who build the future must remember what it means to be human.*
