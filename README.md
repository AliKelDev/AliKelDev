# Hi, I'm Jordan (Alikel)

## About Me

Note : not trying to eventually make money with my projects, i do it because it's fun and it makes my life easier. (mostly because it's fun ^^)
Unless I'm working with someone else of course!

BDR (apprentice) at GitGuardian. I generally like AI and automating stuff. Right now i'm working on a multi agent framework to automate tedious tasks, like creating events in a google calendar, checking my mails, answering to them, give me the perfect diet based on my data, stuff like that. Why BDR then ? Because i'm attending a business school and i have no proof as to what i'm capable of technically lol. That's why i'm trying to build a decent portfolio on there. (still a lot of work to be done haha). 

I like playing with vision models too, by the end of the year i'll probably have a semi autonomous drone, too long to explain here, but it would have a multimodal model, a voice, action tokens, and a parser (for the tokens)

The rest of this readme was written by Claude because i trust him to have that necessary corporate tone way much more than me. 

## Current Projects

### alikel.net - AI Assistant Platform

The central hub for my specialized AI assistants, hosted at [alikel.net](https://alikel.net/). This platform features distinct personalities designed to enhance daily productivity and well-being:

*   **Leif**: A productivity-focused assistant offering smart task management, integrated timers, and organizational tools powered by "Action Tokens" for automation.
*   **Max**: The fitness coach (originally from DeepFit), providing personalized workout plans, fitness profile tracking, and evidence-based guidance.
*   **Multi-Agent Interaction**: Converse with Leif, Max, or both simultaneously for a collaborative experience.
*   **Multimodal Input**: Includes image analysis capabilities for context-aware discussions.

[Live Demo](https://alikel.net/) | [Repository](https://github.com/AliKelDev/alikel.net)

- (it will have a google calendar integration in a short while, it already works but i need to update some front end stuff before making it generally available)

### DeepFit - AI Personal Fitness Coach (Hiatus, working mostly on alikel.net and other projects for now)

An intelligent fitness companion powered by **Max**, the same AI fitness coach featured on the `alikel.net` platform. DeepFit focuses specifically on:

*   Creating customized workout plans based on your fitness profile and available equipment
*   Providing comprehensive progress tracking with detailed analytics
*   Offering form guidance and tailored exercise recommendations
*   Enhancing consistency through personalized coaching

## Professional Philosophy

> "I have this habit where if I encounter a manual task, my brain immediately starts plotting how to automate it. I'm particularly excited about the future of small, specialized models running locally. I love that we live in a time where anyone can build anything."

I'm particularly interested in the evolution of AI towards efficient, specialized models running locally on devices - creating more responsive, private, and accessible intelligence for everyday use.

## The Atlas Paradox

![The Atlas Paradox: Carrying Digital Worlds While Standing in Human Reality](tech-identity-paradox.svg)
- by Claude Sonnet 3.7

"In the space between binary and breath, between efficiency and existence, lives the most interesting paradox of our time: those who build the future must remember what it means to be human."
- Claude Sonnet 3.7
