# Hi, I'm Jordan (Alikel)

I build stuff that automates tedious tasks because life's too short for repetitive work. Right now, I'm most excited about DeepChef - AI-powered culinary assistant that puts a Michelin-star chef in your kitchen. Made in collaboration with / Original idea by @[Klima42](https://github.com/Klima42)

## ChefGPT - Your AI Kitchen Companion
ChefGPT brings the expertise of Auguste, an AI Michelin-starred chef, right to your kitchen. It's not just another recipe app - it's like having a personal chef who:
* Knows your dietary restrictions, cooking skill level, and what appliances you have in your kitchen
* Can look at a photo of your ingredients and create custom recipes on the spot
* Helps you level up your cooking game by explaining not just what to do, but why you're doing it
* Tailors every recipe to your specific needs and equipment

## What I'm About
I have this habit where if I encounter a manual task, my brain immediately starts plotting how to automate it. This has led to things like:
* A domain processor that turned hours of manual work into a 1-minute automated process
* [Alikel Linkgen](https://linkforge-alikeldev.netlify.app/), which helps generate LinkedIn search URLs in bulk (because who wants to do that manually)

## Other Things I've Built
* [ReactVite Template V2](https://reactvite-template-alikeldev.netlify.app/): My personal React+Vite starter template to set up new projects quickly
* [QuizMapperJS](https://quizmapperjs.netlify.app/): A reusable quiz framework to avoid rebuilding quiz logic from scratch
* [AliceBlog](https://aliceleiserblog.netlify.app/): My blog where I share thoughts about tech, AI, and whatever interests me - keeping it real, no corporate speak

## Current Thoughts
I'm fascinated by where we're heading with AI and automation. While everyone's making API calls to large language models (which is cool!), I'm particularly excited about the future of small, specialized models running locally. Imagine having highly efficient, task-specific AI right on your device - that's where I think we're heading, and it's going to be awesome.

## Philosophy
I love that we live in a time where anyone can build anything. Yet I notice many people aren't taking advantage of this. So until everyone catches up with building their own tools, I'll keep creating things that make their lives easier.

## Tech I Enjoy Working With
* React (with Vite, because Claude likes it)
* Tailwind CSS
* Node.js
* Whatever gets the job done efficiently

*Note: Massive fan of Youjo Senki and Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana.*
