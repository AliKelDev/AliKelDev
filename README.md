## Key Projects

### alikel.net - My Personal Website & Project Hub

This is my personal website where I'll be adding projects as I build them. The main thing on the site right now is a chat application I built to try out an idea with multi-agent AI. It's a work-in-progress where I test concepts.

**Current Features on the Site:**
-   **A chat interface** with two AI agents, Leif and Max.
-   **Leif (Productivity):** Is prompted to handle organization. It has access to on-site tools for task management, timers, and can connect to Google Calendar.
-   **Max (Fitness):** Is prompted to act as a fitness coach and can create workout plans based on a user's profile.
-   **Multi-Agent Mode:** You can chat with both at the same time to see how they interact.

**Tech I used:**
-   React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
-   **AI:** Gemini API, Moondream API
-   **Backend:** Netlify Functions
-   **DB for Auth:** Supabase (for the Google Calendar connection)
