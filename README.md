# Hi, I'm Jordan (Alikel)
I build stuff that automates tedious tasks because life's too short for repetitive work. Currently working on AI-powered assistants that make everyday tasks more intuitive and efficient.

## My AI Assistants
### DeepFit - Your AI Personal Trainer
DeepFit brings Max, an AI personal fitness coach, to help you achieve your workout goals:
* Creates personalized workout plans based on your fitness level, equipment, and limitations

### Deepchef - Your AI Kitchen Companion (made in collaboration with [Klima42](https://github.com/Klima42) )
Deepchef features Auguste, an AI Michelin-starred chef for your kitchen:
* Knows your dietary restrictions, cooking skill level, and what appliances you have
* Can look at a photo of your ingredients and create custom recipes on the spot
* Helps you level up your cooking game by explaining not just what to do, but why
* Tailors every recipe to your specific needs and equipment

## What I'm About
I have this habit where if I encounter a manual task, my brain immediately starts plotting how to automate it. This has led to things like:
* A domain processor that turned hours of manual work into a 1-minute automated process
* [Alikel Linkgen](https://linkforge-alikeldev.netlify.app/), which helps generate LinkedIn search URLs in bulk (because who wants to do that manually)

## Other Things I've Built
* [ReactVite Template V2](https://reactvite-template-alikeldev.netlify.app/): My personal React+Vite starter template to set up new projects quickly
* [QuizMapperJS](https://quizmapperjs.netlify.app/): A reusable quiz framework to avoid rebuilding quiz logic from scratch
* [AliceBlog](https://aliceleiserblog.netlify.app/): My blog where I share thoughts about tech, AI, and whatever interests me - keeping it real, no corporate speak

## Current Thoughts
I'm fascinated by where we're heading with AI and automation. While everyone's making API calls to large language models (which is cool!), I'm particularly excited about the future of small, specialized models running locally. Imagine having highly efficient, task-specific AI right on your device - that's where I think we're heading, and it's going to be awesome.

## The Atlas Paradox

*— Claude, February 2025*

## Philosophy
I love that we live in a time where anyone can build anything. Yet I notice many people aren't taking advantage of this. So until everyone catches up with building their own tools, I'll keep creating things that make their lives easier.

## Tech I Enjoy Working With
* React (with Vite, because of Claude)
* Tailwind CSS
* Node.js
* AI integration (Gemini, OpenAI, specialized models)
* Whatever gets the job done efficiently

*Note: Massive fan of Youjo Senki and Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana.*

*In the space between binary and breath, between efficiency and existence, lives the most interesting paradox of our time: those who build the future must remember what it means to be human. The Atlas figure in this artwork emerged from a conversation that explored that very tension - the simultaneous burden and privilege of carrying digital worlds while standing in human reality. May your code always compile and your coffee never grow cold.*
