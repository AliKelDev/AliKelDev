# Hi, I'm Jordan (Alikel)

I build stuff that automates tedious tasks because life's too short for repetitive work.

## What I'm About

I have this habit where if I encounter a manual task, my brain immediately starts plotting how to automate it. This has led to things like:

- A domain processor that turned hours of manual work into a 1-minute automated process
- [Alikel Linkgen](https://github.com/AliKelDev/Alikel-Linkgen), which helps generate LinkedIn search URLs in bulk (because who wants to do that manually)

## Things I've Built

Here are some tools I've created to make my life easier:

- [ReactVite Template V2](https://github.com/AliKelDev/ReactVite-Template-V2): My personal React+Vite starter template to set up new projects quickly

- [QuizMapperJS](https://github.com/AliKelDev/QuizMapperJS): A reusable quiz framework to avoid rebuilding quiz logic from scratch

- [AliceBlog](https://github.com/AliKelDev/AliceBlog): My blog where I will share thoughts about tech, AI, and whatever interests me, i've been tryharding to sound professionnal and stuff on it, but don't feel like it anymore

## Current Thoughts

I'm fascinated by where we're heading with AI and automation. While everyone's making API calls to large language models (which is cool!), I'm particularly excited about the future of small, specialized models running locally. Imagine having highly efficient, task-specific AI right on your device - that's where I think we're heading, and it's going to be awesome. (i really like llms lol)

## Philosophy

I love that we live in a time where anyone can build anything. Yet I notice many people aren't taking advantage of this. So until everyone catches up with building their own tools, I'll keep creating things that make their lives easier.

## Tech I Enjoy Working With
- React (with Vite, because Claude is good at it)
- Tailwind CSS
- Node.js
- Whatever gets the job done efficiently
