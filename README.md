### Professional Summary

At GitGuardian, I specialize in sales operations and automation, creating tools that make our GTM teams more efficient and data-driven.

My work involves identifying operational bottlenecks and building practical, AI-enhanced solutions to solve them. I bridge the gap between technical implementation and business strategy.

Currently completing a Master in Management at NEOMA Business School.

### Professional Experience & Key Projects

**GitGuardian: A Hybrid Role in Operations, Strategy & Product**

While my official role is in business development, my function has evolved to cover several critical areas:

*   **Sales Automation & Operations:** My core focus. I develop internal tools and AI agents that streamline workflows. **Key achievement:** Built an automation that reduced a critical data processing task for the sales team **from several hours to under five minutes**. Developed a suite of AI agents to score deal health (MEDDPICC framework) and identify at-risk renewals for CSMs.

*   **Data Analysis & GTM Strategy:** I handle strategic data projects to guide our go-to-market efforts. Most notably, I led the data analysis for a major industry event processing and enriching the 879-attendee list to create a prioritized targeting strategy that saved the team dozens of hours of manual work.

*   **Team Enablement:** Providing hands-on coaching for finding valuable data, using our internal tools, and understanding the technical nuances of our product.

### Software Development Projects

A collection of personal work where I build practical solutions to real-world problems.

#### **Alikel Linkgen - Prospecting Automation Tool**

Manual creation of complex LinkedIn search queries is slow and error-prone. I built LinkForge as a full-stack web application to solve this.

*   **Functionality:** The tool uses a React/Vite front-end and Netlify Functions on the back-end. Users can input a list of company names, and the application instantly generates validated, bulk Sales Navigator URLs, dramatically speeding up prospecting and account mapping workflows.

#### **alikel.net - Multi-Agent Chat Application**

A custom-built chat application designed to experiment with how specialized AI agents can interact within a single interface. The project explores multi-agent collaboration, testing how different AI personas with unique toolsets can work together to assist a user.

#### **DeepFit - AI Personal Fitness Coach**

An AI-powered web application that acts as a personal fitness coach. This project was a deep dive into building a system that can analyze user input to generate personalized, structured plans and provide data-driven feedback.
